## Execute as server
On a command-line interface go to de directory where the program was downloaded 
ex:
```
 C:Users/usuario/Downloads/Challenge_ruby_BC
```

write: "interactuar" to start the server
	
## Execute as clients

Once the server has already started write on a command line:
```
"Telnet localhost 2000"
```
then you can start using all server functions.

### Some examples to execute as client:


#### To add a key:
you can use either set or add commands, then you shall give the server the name of the key, a flag, the time that you want that key to exist in the server, the amount of bytes of the key value and finally the value of the key

##### Ex:
set/add [noreply] (noreply optional) add key_0 1 77777 5 value

#### To obtain a key: 
use commands get / gets Ex: get/gets get key_0

#### To modify a key-.
use append/prepend/replace or cas Ex 2: append/prepend/replace [noreply] use append to modify the value of the key by adding information at the end of the previus key

##### Ex:
append key 2 88888 9 new_value

##### Ex 2: 
cas [noreply] (noreply optional) use cas to modify a key by knowing the value of cas (unique to the key)

cas key 2 5555 3 cas
	
## Execute tests with rspec gem
 Once the server has already started write on a command line:

```
rspec spec/lib/challenge_test_rspec.rb

```
